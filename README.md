# OpenTracing API for Rust

This library provides API and utilities for using [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/) with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

**Please note that this project is currently under initial development and experimental.** We appreciate feedback and encourage trying it out if you don't mind things breaking between releases.

## Required Reading

In order to understand the Rust API, one must first be familiar with the [OpenTracing project](http://opentracing.io) and [terminology](http://opentracing.io/documentation/pages/spec.html) more specifically.
